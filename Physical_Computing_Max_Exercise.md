### Physical Computing Exercise

Create a patch that utilizes several inputs and/or several outputs with your Arduino. This could be several sensors which control your patch - change volume levels based on light levels, change opacity based on force, change color based on how far a flex sensor is bent, a push button switch to trigger a video/audio file to play. And/or, something happening in your patch (video playing, audio playing, someone moving in a space crosses a point) to trigger output (LED).

I'm looking to see you experiment and create interfaces with physical computing and Max.

Once you get the data in, using the Maxuino library (which utilizes the CNMAT externals), you need to manage that data to what it needs to control. You'll need to use timers, send + recieve, coll objects among the other basic objects I've either suggested or utilized in demo patches. Start simple. Get one thing working properly before adding more.

I'm looking to see everyone up their game in this assignment and to show significant development. For those that had working projects for project 2, I'm looking to see you experiment more.

Requirements:

* Utilization of physical computing to work with a max patch, utilizing several forms of input and/or output, to manipulate media. Make your max patch unique. Don't just hard cut from examples. Tweak them and all to them

* Clear detailed photos of breadboard and wire connections

* max patch posted on your GitHub repo as IOS_PComp_Excerise. Include all other media necessary to run your patch

* 1 minute clear video demonstrating interaction and response (unedited)

* post to your process site: the video (or link to video), clear detailed images of your circuitry, link to the gitub repo with the max patch, a short reflection of the process with your intentions, goals and manner of resolution.
