* **DM-GY 4913-B Special Topics: Interactive Installation**

## Project 2/MidTerm: Memory
## In-class critique: March 19th;
## 20% of your Final Grade

## Materials: Max/MSP/Jitter, openCV, Kinect

Digital applications warp our notion of time, fracturing it with the ability to re-enter previous moments. How does this access shift our understanding of a particular moment, especially as we re-enter it and overwrite it? Does this create a fold or wrinkle that we can continually re-enter? How does this capability affect our memories and shape our identity? ​Drawing up alternate notions of time, capture/recording and playback, this workshop will be an investigation of time and space as we create interactive installations.


This project explores the creation of interactive systems using computer vision and Max/MSP/Jitter. We’ll use Max/MSP/Jitter as the architecture to take input from the physical world and to control output through video and sound. We’ll explore different timing, trigger and looping mechanisms that create folds in time, which we can continually access. Input and output will be discussed, along with feedback loops, interactivity, space and control.


Topics covered: edge detection, frame difference, blob tracking, depth tracking, skeletal tracking


Themes covered: multi-temporality: the time that comes about through the simultaneous assemblage or re-presentation of temporally disparate information. Multi-temporality is within our interactive encounters with digital technologies, as we can recompose nonlinear information, re-experience information, and experience multiple scales of time simultaneously.


Task:

Using Max/MSP/Jitter and openCV, create an interactive experience which explores multi-temporality and memory. Develop an interactive system which explores these notions of time, creating an experience with the past and the present simultaneously.
