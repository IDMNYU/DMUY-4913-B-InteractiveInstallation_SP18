## Challenge 1: Create a Poem with Max

Create an automated poem that utlizes something random/unexpected. The final output of the poem must be unknown to you. The poem must print out to your Max Console window.

You will want to have some bangs happen at regular intervals. What are they banging?

How can you add probabilty, selection, matching, etc to further diversify the outcome?

See the [Max Patch starter](https://github.com/IDMNYU/DMUY-4913-B-InteractiveInstallation_SP18/blob/master/Max_Patches/poem.maxpat) to explore various objects and operations. Comment your code!

### Process:

* Review how Max works with the Luke's 10 Things patcher

* Get some messages to print to the window

* Explore different ways to automate the system

* Explore different ways to randomize, choose, manipulate, augment the poem and it's irregularity.
