# Interactive Installation 

* **DM-GY 4913-B Special Topics: Interactive Installation**


Digital applications warp our notion of time, fracturing it with the ability to re-enter previous moments. How does this access shift our understanding of a particular moment, especially as we re-enter it and overwrite it? Does this create a fold or wrinkle that we can continually re-enter? How does this capability affect our memories and shape our identity? ​Drawing up alternate notions of time, capture/recording and playback, this workshop will be an investigation of time and space as we create interactive installations.

### Introduction:

Memory is related to previous history, or moments in time. Memory can sometimes be readily recalled. At other times it can be fragmented or haphazard. Memory aids can come in a variety of forms, from notebooks, logs, keepsakes, to reminders. We utilize technologies to assist us with our memory. What happens when we literally offload everything to the machine?

[Ollivier Dyen’s “​The Sadness of the Machine​”](http://www.ctheory.net/articles.aspx?id=320) refers to the ability to how technology can be used to create alternative realities, full of diversity. Yet one where the technology begins to control the memory. Many times the record of an event is more important than the actual event. And once there is a recording, the memory can live in infaming and belong to the collective rather than the individual.

Read ​[“​The Sadness of the Machine​”​.](http://www.ctheory.net/articles.aspx?id=320) While doing so, keep the following questions in your mind, as we’ll discuss your responses together next week:

- What is technology's role with memory? How does it impact your memory? How do you see this role evolving or changing within society in 20 years? 40 years?

- How does memory impact self-image and identity? How do different technologies facilitate or obstruct this?


### Memory Devices: Preservation, Change and Manipulation

We find with analog or physical devices charged with assisting our memory, often break down after extended period. That receipt from your shopping trips fades and darkens over time. Those old family photos on paper, yellow or curl over time. The medium here, impacts the memory and information associated with it, as well as the longevity of the medium to exist. Michael Newman discusses this in the short reading - Analog, Chance and Memory.

Read ​Michael Newman’s “​Analog, Chance and Memory​” (​see Slack). Consider the following questions while reading the short text:

- Do you think that digital technologies are perfect preservationists with regard to memory? Why or why not? How will this play out?

- How does the document evolve in its role over time? How does it shift from first recording to 100 years later? How does this affect the particular memory event?

- Can you think of ways to manipulate digital materials to behave as analog memories physically change over time? How might this look or sound?

[The ​whiSprial​ by Elena Corchero, Stefan Agamanolis​](http://medialabeurope.org/hc/projects/whispiral/) is a shawl that carries the voices and thoughts of loved ones. I can imagine how comforting this would be, to be able to surround your body with the voices of your loved ones, far away or long gone.

Inherent with any software development, is politics or the bias of the system. Software is powerful, with the ability to execute tasks and to control devices with unimaginable speed. Software is developed for a variety of tasks. Once I find concerning is the development of ​[Adobe’s VoCo, essentially a photoshop for sound. Watch the demo here, with Jordan Peele.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3l4XLZ59iw)​ Such software is going to make finding the truth, much more difficult and fake news something ever-present on our media landscape. How can we fight back?

There is a brilliant [Radio Lab episode](http://www.radiolab.org/story/breaking-news/) that dives in deeper with reference technologies impact on the news​. Give it a listen, if you have the time.

What are the ethics surrounding memorial bots - artificial intelligence software and machine learning software that is fed a history of our lost love ones - text messages, emails - all words that they have spoken? Using such bots, we can interact with our loved ones in the present, long after they are gone. What sort of issues does this create? (Don’t believe me?

### Manipulation of Time and Creating New Time

Working with technology allows us to capture and to manipulate media, most especially over time. It’s possible to show the past and the present simultaneously, and the very moment of temporality. Gilles Deleuze, a French philosopher from the 1960’s, wrote about how technology can capture and condense the very movement of temporality in a crystallized formation:


“What constitutes the crystal-image is the most fundamental operation of time: since the past is constituted not after the present that it was but at the same time, time has split itself in two at each moment as present and past, which differ from each other in nature, or, what amounts to the same thing, it has to split the present into two heterogeneous directions, one of which is launched towards the future while the others falls into the past. Time has to split at the same time as it sets itself out or unrolls itself: it splits in two dissymmetrical jets, one of which makes all the present pass on, while the other preserves all the past. Time consists of this split, and it is this, it is time, that we see in the crystal.” (Gilles Deleuze, Cinema 2: The time Image (1985) (London:Athlone Press, 1989) 81.


Deleuze speaks of time being split in different directions, with reference to the past, present and future making an analogy to a developing crystal. ​[Have you ever watched a crystal form​?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ou1bIDn1xE) We can see how time is really a matter of forking paths that form networks and intersections.


How can we traverse these paths? Is it possible to see the activity of another path at the same time as our own? When we remember something, are we reliving that past in our current present? Can we slow down our rate of travel along this memory path? What if we take our most recent past, and re-enter it in a feedback loop?

Below is a discussion of 3 artists: David Claerbout, Bill Viola and Dan Graham taken from Timothy Scott Barker’s book, ​_Time and The Digital: Connecting Technology, Aesthetics and a Process Philosophy of Time​._ They are provided to give you some insight about different ways of manipulating time (forking time, recursive time, slow time, elongating temporality, etc) using image and video to reference memory, spirituality and different philosophies of time.

David Claerbout ​i​s a Belgian artist that ​uses still and moving images to talk about time and different increments of time, especially to create an extended presentness.

“He refutes an impression of time as a neatly linear sequence of presents. Presentness if an accumulation of past images, extended into the present. The still photographos initiate an extension of past over present, the past moment, presented in the photographic image, extends into the present, past its usual temporal limit.


In his piece ​[Kindergarten Antonio Sant’Elia, 1932​ (1998)​](https://davidclaerbout.com/Kindergarten-Antonio-Sant-Elia-1932-1998), he uses a single-channel projection where we see slowing moving leaves in an otherwise still photograph of small children planting saplings. The work is based on a found photograph depicting the development of a school in Como, Italy. By subtling manipulating only the saplings in the image, the slow movement of the leaves alludes to the movement of the wind and the passage of time, which is in stark contrast to the stillness of the children and their environment. Within the photographic representation of the past is the subtle suggestion of passing time. The pastness of the image, as illustrated by the image of the children taken in 1932, that have grown old and have now most likely passed away, is brought into our contemporary, with our experience of the present.

Claerbout further grapples with questions of time in his work ​[Bordeau Piece (2004).](https://davidclaerbout.com/Bordeaux-Piece-2004) In this work a ten-minute narrative seems to loop continuously throughout the hours of a day. The narrative of this work.....deals with the betrayal felt as a young man’s girlfriend enters into a love affair with his father. Although this theme is emotionally charged, it becomes trivial when set within the larger scope of the work. This narrative is played out by the actors and refilmed over a thirteen-hour duration, the only indication of the passing of time being the gradually changing light conditions. The characters, in a sense, relive this narrative event repeatedly, slightly different each time, throughout the passage of the day. In essence, Claerbout, as with Serres and Deleuze, is grappling with time along a slower scale of the temporal, in which the narrative events are a foreground playing out against the background of a slow and relentless viscous flow.....The ten-minute narrative of ​_Bordeau Piece​_ is nested within the larger thirteen-hour duration of the entire work. Further, within the ten-minute narrative are nested smaller narrative events, and within these events are nested other events of shorter durations. Viewed this way the work is understood as a complex of nested durations being repeated over the duration of the screening....durations can be infinitely large or small, and like Russian dolls, they are nested within each other.....This fleeting moment is repeated throughout Claerbout’s work; it is given the appearance of permanence. It is an occasion that is remade at each durational moment in the work. The repetition of the past that he represents is subsequently juxtaposed with the viewing present....in Claerbout’s work a cumulative past re-enters and inflates the viewing present.” ​ (excerpt from Time and The Digital by Timothy Barker)

[Bill Viola​](http://www.billviola.com/) is a video artist that is concerned with memory and perception via technological means as a way to explore emotions and investigations of spirituality. He often slows time, such as in his work, ​[The Greeting​ (1995)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg0IyGUVXaQ) which is inspired by The Visitation, where “​Virgin Mary to her older cousin Elizabeth, who acknowledges that the child Mary is carrying is the Son of God. Viola‘s video sequence echoes the drama of Pontormo’s Visitation, but transforms the ancient Christian moment into an enigmatic contemporary narrative.” (Whitney Museum of American Art, New York; Partial and promised gift of Marion Stroud in honor of David A. Ross). Viola extends a forty-five second script event to ten minutes. As a result of slowing the frames down,

“he provides the opportunity for our cognition of the aesthetic event to catch up to our affective involvement with the occasions embedded in the event. By slowing down time, Viola extends the affective moment and allows cognition to catch up to affect, to allow the brain to register the multiple impulses that the body opens itself to....it....produces a time that moves slow and viscous flow over our experience of lived reality. The piece in this sense seems to emphasize the pace of the world around us and the quickness of time that we produce in our day-to-day lives.......Because of the slowness of usually rapid events, everything for the fact that it is afforded a great deal of narrative time. The normally fleeting facial expressions and bodily movement of the actors, their inaudible whispers, and the aforementioned strong breeze and the sparks that are emitted from the women’s touch are all central constitutive elements of the temporal composition and as such are all given consequence. The reality of the biblical event illustrated in Viola’s work is thus re-presented in such a way that gives great importance to every minute detail within the larger narrative event.”
(excerpt from Time and The Digital by Timothy Barker)


Dan Graham is a video artist that manipulates time to represent time in different ways, such as presenting time in a nonlinear fashion. Graham uses surveillance techniques and time delays to present several temporal episodes simultaneously.

“In these installations, Graham provides the experience of a present moment that visibly contains the events of the part. Here time is not presented as a linear flow but rather a recursive. Past events repeat, being re-presented in the present. Graham presents a moment in time not as a compartmentalized present, as though a point on a line or a bead on a string. He instead presents a moment in time as an occasion that ostensibly draws into itself many other occasions from the past.

In ​[Present Continuous Past(s)​](https://www.google.com/search?q=Present+Continuous+Past(s)&tbm=isch&tbo=u&source=univ&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwirk-7q4M3YAhXvcd8KHf-tDW0QsAQINQ&biw=1194&bih=730) ​the participant enters a room with mirrored walls. The mirrors reflect the present movements of the participant. A camera mounted on the wall also records the movement from the participant and his or her reflection from the mirrored surfaces. This recording is then fed into a monitor directly under the camera and in front of the viewer with an eight second delay; the delayed image is then reflected into the opposite mirror, thus the camera catches not only the participant’s present movements but also those that are presented through the monitor, subject to the eight-second delay. A recursive reflection is thus set up between the monitor and the mirror. At any point of present there are multiple temporal versions of the participant. Firstly, they are in present time, as they are aware of themselves as physically present in the space. Secondly, there is an image of the participant eight seconds earlier displayed on the monitor and in the reflection of the monitor in the mirror. Thirdly, there are images of the participant going back in time in eight-second increments as the camera again captures the reflection of the monitor in the mirror, subjected to the eight-second delay, and displayed on the monitor. The result of this is that the participant sees many versions of themselves on the monitor going back in time, always separated by eight seconds; they see themselves standing in front of the monitor as they were eight seconds earlier, sixteen seconds earlier, twenty-four seconds earlier, and so on. There is, at any moment of the present, an interaction with the participant’s cumulative past.

In Graham’s ​Present continuous Past(s)​ there is the disruption of the notion of linear flowing time caused by the instantaneous display of different moments in time. In other words, the nonlinear production of a once linear time is achieved through the instantaneous display of those events that we commonly experience as occurring as successive moments. In this work, linear time becomes this, as we experience a past that lingers in the present.

...Eight seconds is the outer temporal limit of neurophysiological short-term memory, which forms an integral part of our perception and construction of images. The result of the eight-second delay in Graham’s work is that the viewer associates their movements re-presented in the time-lagged footage with their present state.....Here, the past, residing in virtuality, is made actual upon one of the monitors. This is displayed next to the actual present that it influences. In a sense, they wath an event, but can simultaneously feel the lingering experience of the event, which is then invested in the next event.”
(excerpt from Time and The Digital by Timothy Barker)

Another artist that also utilizes the past, bring it into the present is [Lincoln Schatz. In his archived works​,](http://lincolnschatz.com/selected-artworks/) you can find several examples where he created portraits of spaces and people. In these, he captures multiple instances of a space, and threads them all together to make a video montage. The past is constantly served back up in the present, yet, one never knows exactly when it will appear. The portraits are live and evolving memories. Check out ​his piece [Stitch​.](http://lincolnschatz.com/selected-artworks/stitch/)


Barker proposes a multi-temporality: the time that comes about through the simultaneous assemblage or re-presentation of temporally disparate information. Multi-temporality is within our interactive encounters with digital technologies, as we can recompose nonlinear information, re-experience information, and experience multiple scales of time simultaneously.


Please sketch out 3 ideas concerning multi-temporality: time manipulation and media. Please bring in media that you would like to utilize in the workshop, or sketch out ideas that capture live footage. Think about how you can bring different instances of the past into the present, feed the present back into the past in a recursive loop, or to manipulate a timeline. How might this product look? Is it taking up the entire frame? Is it a collage? Are the images manipulated, fractured, split? Do they have changing colors or opacities? What triggers changes or the media appearance? Do we touch a button, wave our hands or stand in a particular spot? We’ll be working with cameras to make these ideas a reality.

The more you can sketch out these ideas, the better. Go into detail. Bring other resources, visuals or examples of other’s work that inspires you. The more you come with the further you’ll go with the materials. I’m looking forward to hearing your ideas and listening to your responses to this material above.
