Headings to have:
no adds.

Only for this class. Professional. Not lazy and direct to me. Other people in the class will be reviewing them.

Each post should have some arrangement of the following:

* What it is that you are posting? What is this code? What does it do? What are your ideas? Why are they important? What's the background context to situation this? 

* What are other related artists, designers, projects, firms, expos, movements, etc to this?

* What is the next step? What is the current issue? How can this be resolved? How can this improve? When will these things next happen? What resources do you need to identify and locate in order to assist you?

* What independent resources are you using, to assist you? Is it working/helpful? Why or why not?
